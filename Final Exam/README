This project uses a combination of Depth-First Search (DFS) and memoization. For every position in the matrix, the algorithm 
attempts to move to any neighbor with a lower altitude, computes how long the resulting path would be, and keeps the best 
outcome. Once the longest path from a cell is known, it is cached and reused, which reduces the runtime.
The longest_path() function manages the memo table and checks every possible starting point, while dfs(x, y) performs the 
actual recursive exploration of downhill neighbors. These components provide a solution for finding the longest descending
ski route.
