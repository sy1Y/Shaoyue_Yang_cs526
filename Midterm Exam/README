#How to Run:
I wrote the program using Python idle (compiler) 3.11 and ran it in the Windows terminal (cmd).
I used the input file provided by Blackboard. For problem1, I used snowfall_input1.txt for testing; 
For problem2, I used both pandemic_input2.txt and pandemic_input1.txt;
For problem3, I used both sc_input1.txt and sc_input2.txt;
For problem4, I used both spg_input1.txt and spg_input2.txt.
Finally, I uploaded my output as a screenshot.

#The heart of my algorithm
Problem1: I started recording the daily snowfall increment from 0. Secondly, I need to ensure the number
of all possible consecutive three-day within the total number of days. Thus, I think the core of the algorithm is
that the number of iterations comparing the accumulated snowfall over three days to half of the total snowfall.
