#Problem1ï¼šI wrote it using both colab and local IDLE complier. It can upload files without the specific file name.
#Problem2: The input for my test program is: abcab, which is the same as the ppt input.
#Problem3: The input for my test program is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, which is the same as the ppt input.
#Problem4: I wrote it using both colab and local IDLE complier. It can upload files without the specific file name.

For Problem1 and problem4, if you don't want to use colab to test it, my other two Hw3_Problem4.py and Hw3_Problem1.py 
files can be run in local python without colab.
