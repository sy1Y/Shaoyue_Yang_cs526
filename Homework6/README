In insertion_sort, for each new element encountered, it scans backward through the already-sorted portion to identify the
correct insertion point. This backward scanning continues until it finds an element smaller than the current one or 
reaches the beginning of the array, shifting larger elements rightward to create space. 
In merge_sort, the algorithm repeatedly splitting the input array into halves. During the merge phase, two sorted 
subarrays are combined into a larger sorted array using a two-pointer comparison. 
In quick_sort, the algorithm selects a pivot element and partitions the remaining elements into L,E,G and creates a 
partial ordering. The algorithm then recursively applies the same process to the less-than and greater-than partitions,
while elements equal to the pivot remain in their final positions. 
To verify the efficiency of the sorting code, I added the time.time() function to measure the running time of each 
sorting algorithm and making it easy to compare the performance of different algorithms. Besides, to ensure the 
correctness of all three sorting algorithms, I use boolean verification to check if the sorted arrays match the results 
from Python's built-in sorted() function. 
Through analysis, insertion sort is suitable for situations with small data sizes. Merge sort preserves the original 
order of equal elements and has stable performance, making it suitable for processing large amounts of data. Quick sort 
is the fastest general-purpose sorting algorithm and is suitable for handling situations with limited memory.

For Problem2, 
→How to Run: run it using the following command in the Windows terminal (cmd): python P2.py < "Input1.txt"
→Heart of algorithms:
the algorithm processes numbers through multiple passes, one for each digit position. In each pass, 
numbers are distributed into 10 buckets (0-9) based on the current digit being examined. Numbers are collected from the
buckets in ascending order.The process repeats for each subsequent digit position until all digits are processed. 
Radix sort is suitable for integer data or data that can be converted to an integer representation.

For Problem3,
→How to Run: run it using the following command in the Windows terminal (cmd): python gale.py < "marriage_hundred.txt"
→Heart of algorithms:
This implementation of the Gale–Shapley algorithm adopts the female-optimal matching while ensuring stability. The 
essential mechanism operates during the proposal phase: an unmatched woman proposes to a man she prefers; if the man 
is also unmatched, they form an engagement. If the man is already engaged, he compares the new proposer with his 
current partner and retains the woman he prefers more, and dissolves his existing engagement.
