→How to run: run it using the following command in the Windows terminal (cmd): python hw7.py < "input.txt"

→Heart of algorithms:
Define a simple HuffmanNode class to store the character, frequency, and pointers to its left and right child nodes. Internal 
nodes only store the combined frequency.
For encoding, the program first reads all input text and uses Counter to count character frequencies. With these counts, it 
builds the Huffman Tree by repeatedly taking the two smallest nodes from a priority queue, merging them, and putting the new 
node back in. When only one node remains, that becomes the root.
The program then generates the Huffman codes by traversing the tree: traversing left adds a "0", traversing right adds a "1", 
and the leaf nodes record the final codes. Using these codes, the text is converted into a long binary string and saved in the
compressed.bin file along with the complete encoding table and the length of the encoded data.
For decoding, the program reads the codebook and rebuilds the tree by inserting each code path starting from a fresh root. Then
it reads the encoded bits, trims the padding, and decodes them by walking the tree until it reaches leaf nodes. The final 
reconstructed text is written to reconstructed.txt.
