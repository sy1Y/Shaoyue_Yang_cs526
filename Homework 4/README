#Problem1
By preorder three traversal, the sequence is A→B→E→H→F→IC→D→G.
By breadth-first tree traversal, the sequence is A→B→C→D→E→F→G→H→I.
By post tree traversal, the sequence is H→E→I→F→B→C→G→D→A.
By in-order tree traversal, the sequence is G→D→B→E→A→C→H→F→I. 

For Problem2 and Problem3, I downloaded the three files and ran the program on each using cmd command 
and then checked the results.

Difficulty：
In problem 2, what is the minimum number of elements in the array that I need to take so that their sum is greater than T? 
Besides trying every combination one by one, what is the fastest way to find this.

In problem 3,
